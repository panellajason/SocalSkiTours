From the base of Coachella Valley to the summit, San Jacinto rises over 11,000 feet. The good news is that there's a tram that will take you about 80% of the way there. The terrain varies from open bowls and well spaced trees up top to tight, treed canyons below. Since this is east facing it holds soft snow well early/mid winter and softens nicely during corn cycles in spring. A GPS is recommended as it is easy to get disoriented on this mountain. From the Palm Springs Aerial Tramway, take the Round Valley trail up through Round Valley. From here, you can either continue heading west and up to Jean Peak (10,670 feet) or traverse north for about a mile or so and then up to the San Jacinto summit (10,833 feet).", title: "San Jacinto: East Face", aspect: "E", base: "8,500 ft", trailhead: "Palm Springs Tramway", summit: "10,800 ft", angle: "20-30")

This couloir is very steep and sustained and avalanches frequently. With nearly 10k vert to reach the summit, extreme bushwhacking and large waterfalls which may require ropes, Snow Creek doesn't get climbed that often, let aloned skied. The crux of the route, the Chockstone, is only skiable during the best of seasons, such as when Andy Lewicky skied it in the El Nino year of 2010 (check out his report on Sierra Descents). Even during good seasons, there will be no shortage of bushwhacking and rockclimbing as this route starts at nearly 1,000 feet on the desert floor. The standard approach goes through DWA land where trespassing is not allowed but this can be avoided by traversing around as the route on the map shows. Park at the utility station (33.898705, -116.679772) and head east to climb the ridge on east side of Falls Creek. Climb this ridge until 4,300 feet and then traverse underneath the ridge until you reach what is known as the Isthmus. From here, climb up and around Snow Creek on the east side and enter the couloir at ~5,500 feet. Follow this couloir to the summit.", title: "San Jacinto: Snow Creek", aspect: "N", base: "1,200 ft", trailhead: "Snow Creek Trailhead", summit: "10,850 ft", angle: "40-45")
