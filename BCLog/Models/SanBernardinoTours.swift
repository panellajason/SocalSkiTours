In good corn cycles, these chutes and the North chutes are a great link-up since these will soften first due to their easterly exposure to the sun. This exposure also allows the snow to heat up fairly quickly and wet slides are common throughout the season. Cornices form at the entrances to some of these chutes and wind-affected snow is common.

Today, it is known as a rite of passage in SoCal backcountry skiing and also offers the easiest way up the San Gorgonio/Jepson saddle. The Big Draw is an excellent catcher's mitt for snow as it is essentially a large bowl positioned between two windstrewn peaks. It is usually the last remaining snow in Southern California, sometimes having patches last into July. In 2019, this was skiable for several thousand feet well into June. This last winter season (2021), however, much of this area was hardly rideable or never became rideable due to lack of snow. Follow the South Fork Trail for 3.5 miles, then cross South Fork meadows and continue up through the trees.

Winter skiing conditions are variable at this elevation due to winds and it is not uncommon for the upper few hundred feet of some of the chutes to be wind-stripped. The north face of San Gorgonio is also known for its massive avalanches (See pic 4 of the 2019 Valentines Day slides, courtesy of Socalsnow.org; these occurred after a large atmopsheric river and high snow levels). Spring is the most popular season to ride and climb Gorgonio (the snow is consolidated and quick to travel on, the days are longer, and the riding conditions are consistent). If skiing conditions are favorable, these chutes feel like your average black-diamond ski resort run despite the mountain looking like a giant from afar. This area was under threat of development in the mid 1900s, but the ultimate decision was that âSan Gorgonio Primitive Area has a higher public value as a wilderness and a watershed than as a downhill ski areaâ. Either follow the Big Draw route to the San Gorgonio ridge, or branch off when the North face comes into view and climb those chutes for a slightly steeper but more direct route. Note: the actual summit of San Gorgonio is about a mile in the easterly direction from the North face and offers no additional skiing, unless you are looking to drop in to the steep bowl just below the summit (which doesn't get ridden all that often).", marker: gorgNMarker, aspect: "N", base: "6,900 ft", trailhead: southForkTH, summit: "11,500 ft", angle: "30-35")

Nearly the entire South Fork trail is a burn area and so is this descent, so there are many fallen trees and new-growth bushes scattered throughout the landscape that must be covered. This area makes for good storm day/post storm day riding due to its low-angle slopes, protection from the wind and higher elevation for more powdery snow. Follow the South Fork Trail for about 1.5 miles and skin up the north facing trees and series of small gullies until you reach your desired elevation.", marker: altoTreesMarker, aspect: "N", base: "6,900 ft", trailhead: southForkTH, summit: "10,000 ft", angle: "25")
