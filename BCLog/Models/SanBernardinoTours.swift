Winter skiing conditions are variable at this elevation due to winds and it is common for the upper few hundred feet of some of the chutes to be wind-stripped. The north face of San Gorgonio is also known for its massive avalanches (See pic 4 of the 2019 Valentines Day slides, courtesy of Socalsnow.org; these occurred after a large atmopsheric river and high snow levels). Spring is the most popular season to ride and climb Gorgonio; the snow is consolidated and quick to travel on, the days are longer, and the riding conditions are consistent during melt-freeze cycles. If skiing conditions are favorable, these chutes feel like your average black-diamond ski resort run despite the mountain looking like a giant from afar. This area was under threat of development in the mid 1900s, but the ultimate decision was that âSan Gorgonio Primitive Area has a higher public value as a wilderness and a watershed than as a downhill ski areaâ. Either follow the Big Draw route to the San Gorgonio ridge as the route shows, or branch off when the North face comes into view and climb the chutes for a slightly steeper but more direct route.

There are lots of downed trees and rocks which need to be covered . The upper pitch has some short, steep chutes that are great for doing multiple laps and practicing for more committing terrain in the area. Despite looking like a tame descent, keep in mind there aren't any trees in this area for a reason; avalanches from the upper pitch cleared them out. Follow the South Fork Trail for about 2 miles until the lower pitch (a large clearing of trees) comes into view, then cautiously follow the lower and upper pitch up to the summit. Alternatively, approach via the North Trees route.", marker: altoMarker, aspect: "NE", base: "6,900 ft", trailhead: southForkTH, summit: "10,200 ft", angle: "30-35")

This area makes for good storm day/post storm day riding due to its low-angled slopes, protection from the wind, and higher elevation for more powdery snow.

The snow quality is usually decent up high and since much of the mountain is north facing with protection from trees, it holds soft snow quite well during winter months. Spring can also be fun. Follow forest road 2N23 for a mile or so and branch off the road for your desired tour.
