The road is usually closed a few miles back from the trailhead in winter (so check Caltrans before driving up) but many people will still walk/skin the road to ski the mountain. Once the road opens, Baden Powell is a popular spring skiing destination due to its easy access and sheltered, north facing gullies which hold snow well into a good season. There are many different gullies and chutes to choose from on this mountain, but be aware of waterfalls/drop-offs as some of the descents contain these features. Even the usual NE gullies have some steep, narrow sections at some point in the ski down. Be mindful of stability concerns as these gullies avalanche frequently during/after storm cycles. Crust, ice, windboard, corn, and powder can all be present at the same time on BP so angle and aspect are everything when it comes to finding the best snow. The normal approach from Vincent Gulch parking lot is quite steep and will be icy in the morning, usually requiring crampons for safe travel, but the route slowly gives way to gentler slopes as you gain in elevation.", marker: badenMarker, aspect: "NE", base: "6,600 ft", trailhead: badenTH, summit: "9,400 ft", angle: "30-35")

On a clear weekend with sufficient snow, you may see 20-30+ hikers/skiers ascending the Bowl like a line of ants, a few skiers descending various chutes, all while a helicopter circles the ski hut making a rescue; it can be a circus out there sometimes. Despite all this, \"Baldy\" is the best alpine terrain in Southern California that has views to the ocean and hosts one of the only ski huts in the region (built in 1936). During good snow years, at least 10+ chutes are rideable varying in length, aspect and angle. The looker's left chutes are slightly steeper and more couloir-esque compared to the chutes in the center of the bowl. Due to the rocky nature of the bowl and its south-east aspect, storms really need to pile up to make a sufficient base before it melts right away. That being said, it can go from rocks to rideable with one big storm and some rock skis. Spring conditions (corn, melt/freeze cycles) plague the Bowl all season, except after the coldest and driest of storms when powder may last for one or two days. Follow the Baldy Bowl trail to the Ski Hut (which crosses numerous avalanche paths on the way up), then traverse to the looker's left of the Bowl and ascend the trees. Once atop this section, follow the ridge up to the chutes. Alternatively, climb the chute of choice but beware of constant rockfall and avalanches (climbers/skiers get caught in slides almost every year). An early start and an early finish is critical on these solar slopes.", marker: baldyBowlMarker, aspect: "S/E", base: "6,100 ft", trailhead: baldyTH, summit: "10,000 ft", angle: "40-45")

To start, you have to hike back up to the summit after riding the line (after nearly 4,000 vert to get to the summit in the first place) because that's the only way out. Next, as Andy Lewicky (SierraDescents.com) puts it, 'The North face is usually an ice rink' for most of the season due to excessively high, moisture-laden winds. By the time spring comes around and the North face starts to soften, the Bowl is usually too melted out to descend to the ski hut making the skiing-to-hiking ratio quite low. Finally, the North Face ends in a steep, narrow couloir (aptly named the Bottleneck Couloir) which is more of a waterfall; but this feature can be avoided by traversing skier's right at the ~9,000 ft mark as the last picture shows. All of the various lines down the North face and West Baldy's North Face are impressively steep and sustained, looking almost Colorado-esque from afar. Take the ski hut trail to Mt Baldy's summit and make sure you can climb back up the line you skied.

As with most of Socal's alpine, the best time to ride these chutes is in spring during melt/freeze cycles since winter can be quite variable and/or unstable. A short ski down from the lifts and a short skin up to the summit is all it takes to reach these chutes; getting back up to the ski resort is another challenge on its own which can be approached a few different ways.

Boasting the first chairlift in Southern California and the second in the state, Waterman opened in 1939 and is a gem in Southern California's ski history. The website is still active and lift-accessed skiing does happen here, so don't be suprised if the resort is open when you arrive; just drive down the road and ski something else (Krakta Ridge, Buckhorn, Throop, Islip). The joys of Waterman are its steep ski runs, tight gullies and parking as close as it gets to the goods. There are plently of other options just off of the resort area as well, such as the Avalanche Chutes off of the summit which drop you a few miles down the road from the parking area. Beware of icy conditions after long periods of no snow in winter (which is a common occurrence here); the resort is steep and north facing so it doesn't soften much until late winter/early spring. Highway 2 can be quite fickle with opening after a storm so keep an eye on Caltrans before making the drive. The western San Gabriels are low elevation and very close to the ocean so San Gabriel Cement/Stucco (similar to Sierra Cement but worse) is common.", marker: watermanMarker, aspect: "N", base: "6,800 ft", trailhead: watermanTH, summit: "7,800 ft", angle: "25-30")
