On a clear weekend with sufficient snow, you may see 20-30+ hikers/skiers ascending the Bowl like a line of ants, 5 skiers descending various chutes, all while a helicopter circles the ski hut making a rescue; it can be a circus out there sometimes. Despite all this, this is some of the best alpine terrain in Souther California which explains why it hosts one of the only ski huts in the region. During good snow years, at least 10+ chutes are rideable varying in length, aspect and angle. The looker's left of the bowl is more couloir/crag-like while the chutes in the center of the bowl are slightly wider and shorter. Due to the rocky nature of the bowl and its southeast aspect, storms really need to pile up to make a sufficient base. That being said, it can go from rocks to rideable with one big storm and some rock skis. Spring conditions (corn, melt/freeze cycles) plague the Bowl all season, except after the coldest and driest of storms when powder may last one or two days. The looker's left of the Bowl tends to be rideable the earliest, and latest, in the season. Follow the Baldy Bowl trail to the Ski Hut, then traverse to the looker's left of the Bowl and ascend the trees. Once atop this section, follow the ridge up to the chutes. Alternatively, climb the chute of choice but beware of constant rockfall and avalanches (climbers/skiers get caught in slides every year, even during low snow years). Always start early and be out of the bowl early as this terrain heats up quickly and many are injured here every year.", marker: baldyBowlMarker, aspect: "S/E", base: "6,100 ft", trailhead: baldyTH, summit: "9,800 ft", angle: "30-45")

To start, you have to hike back up to the summit after riding the line (after nearly 4,000 vert to get to the summit in the first place) because there's no way out. Next, as Andy Lewicky (SierraDescents.com) puts it, 'The North face is usually an ice rink' for most of the season due to excessively high, moisture-laden winds. By the time spring comes around and North face starts to soften, the Bowl is usually too melted out to descend to the ski hut making the skiing-to-hiking ratio quite low. Finally, the North Face ends in a steep, narrow couloir (aptly named the Bottleneck Couloir) which is more of a waterfall; but this feature can be avoided by traversing skier's right at the ~9,000 ft mark. All of the various lines down the North face and West Baldy's North Face are impressively steep and sustained, looking almost Colorado-esque from afar. Take the normal approach to Mt Baldy's summit and make sure you can climb back up the line you skied.

The best time to ride these chutes are in spring during melt/freeze cycles since winter can be quite variable.

Boasting the first chairlift in Southern California and second in the state, Waterman opened in 1939 and is a gem in Southern California's ski history. The website is still active and lift-accessed skiing does happen here, so don't be suprised if the resort is open when you arrive; just drive down the road and ski something else (Krakta Ridge, Buckhorn, Throop, Islip). The joys of Waterman are its steep ski runs, tight gullies and parking as close as it gets to the goods. There are plently of other options just off of the resort area as well. Some of which that are much more committing and dangerous than the normal Waterman day, such as the Avalanche Chutes off of the summit which drop you a few miles down the road from the parking area. Highway 2 can be quite fickle with opening after a storm so keep an eye on Caltrans before making the drive. The western San Gabriels are lower elevation and very close to the ocean so San Gabriel Cement/Stucco (similar to Sierra Cement but worse) is common.", marker: watermanMarker, aspect: "N", base: "6,800 ft", trailhead: watermanTH, summit: "7,800 ft", angle: "25-30")
